                    <h1>Hi, I`m Liz. I`m a Full Stack Developer and UX Designer. I served in the military for 6 years
                        and
                        loved every second of
                        it, but I needed something new that would challenge me. I was introduced to coding by a SGT of
                        mine
                        and that is when my
                        journey began. So I started to teach myself some code. I began with vanilla HTML and CSS and
                        instantly fell in love. I
                        wanted to learn more but didn`t know where to start. That`s when I learned about bootcamps. I
                        enrolled in devCodeCamp,
                        it was a 12 week Full Stack course. I graduated December 2022. But I wasn`t done, I wanted to
                        learn
                        more! So I enrolled
                        in Google`s course for UX Design. I learned a lot of amazing things including how to make the
                        User
                        Experience better and
                        more inclusive. As I continue my journey I have started taking Scrimbas course for Front End
                        Development and plan to
                        learn a lot more. I am excited to start a career and learn from more experienced developers and
                        also
                        share my knowledge
                        in the process. If you have any questions please reach out, I would love to hear from you.
